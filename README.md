Box Windows V2 SDK
==================
Fork of Windows SDK for v2 of the Box API (https://github.com/box/box-windows-sdk-v2)

Key changes:
* Targets .NET Framework 4.5.1 instead of PCL (no support of W8/WP platforms)
* Removes lots of external dependencies (all the BCL libraries that were needed for PCL support, Nito.AsyncEx)
* Some URLs changed to boxenterprise.net to avoid country specific blocking
